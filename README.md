Polytechnic Microprojects

This repository contains the files and documents for various microprojects that I have completed as part of my polytechnic course. The microprojects cover topics such as assistance bot using IR sensor, MWC flip teach A&S, and EST MP report.

Contents
ASSISTANCE BOT USING IR SENSOR PPT.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation that explains the design and implementation of an assistance bot that uses an infrared sensor to detect obstacles and avoid collisions.
EST MP REPORTword.docx: A Word document that contains the report for the EST microproject, which involves creating a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
MWC FLIP TEACH A&S.pptx: A PowerPoint presentation that summarizes the key concepts and applications of analog and digital signals, modulation, and demodulation for the MWC microproject.
MWC MP REPORT.docx: A Word document that contains the report for the MWC microproject, which involves designing and testing a simple AM radio receiver circuit.
